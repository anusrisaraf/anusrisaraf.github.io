                <span class="section">
                    <p>i have quite the varied background in music, both as a performer and composer.
                        music has always played a strong role in my life, as i started dancing soon after
                        i learned to walk, and began to take vocal lessons soon after that. as a dancer,
                        i studied many styles for short periods of time, including ballet and hip hop, but
                        stuck with bharatnatyam (indian classical dance) for the longest. i also studied vocals in the context of indian
                        classical music.</p>
                    <p>in elementary school, i was always fiddling with the piano at home (receiving formal piano instruction during my undergrad),
                        and began to learn how to play violin. i continued to study violin as a primary instrument
                        throughout middle and high school, taking lessons, performing in ensembles, serving
                        as concertmaster of my high school orchestra. i took a more active approach to music
                        in high school, founding a music club, picking up the ukulele and guitar, and venturing
                        into the realm of producing. my family and i also began to perform as vocalists at charity events. my high school musical experience culminated with a solo performance
                    of seitz student concerto no. 5 accompanied by the orchestra i led, although i pursued more advanced pieces to perform
                at solo recitals. a high school dream of mine was to publish an album of my own, and i currently hope to resume work on
            this project in the near future. i am also currently a part of MIT's concert choir.</p>
                    <p>here are some of my writings about music and compositions (a small collection which i hope to grow as i pursue my
                        music minor).</p>

                    in my elementary, middle, and high school years. now, i find joy in crafting smaller works of writing for
